### Hey, I'm Robby.

I'm a lead software engineer, specializing in front-end development.

I'm the co-founder of the non-profit organization [Easy EC](https://easyec.org), a webapp to increase access to emergency contraception for those who need it most.

I'm currently a lead software engineer at [McKesson](https://github.com/mckesson), focusing on improving cancer care.

I'm working on an evolving personal project of engineering exploration called the ['site'](https://github.com/RobbyCowell/site).
